# How to create custom report controls


<p>This example demonstrates how to create a <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/CustomDocument1304">custom <strong>ProgressBar</strong> control</a>.</p>
<p>In this example, the progress bar control is implemented as a filled rectangle with variable width, and serves as a graphical representation of a numerical value. This custom control has two primary properties - <strong>Position</strong> and <strong>MaxValue</strong>. The <strong>Position</strong> property determines the current progress for the value tracked by this control (how much of the bar is filled in with the progress color). The <strong>MaxValue</strong> property determines the maximum value for the <strong>Position</strong> property and the scale used by the progress bar. Note that the <strong>Position</strong> property is bindable, which allows the progress bar control to be used in data-aware reports.<br><br><strong>See also</strong>
